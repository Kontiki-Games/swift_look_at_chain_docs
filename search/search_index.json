It introduces the ability to drive an entire bone chain with a single node, making editing more intuitive, convenient, and efficient. Features Full Feature Inheritance \u2014 Retains nearly all features from Swift Look At for compatibility and a familiar workflow. \u2192 View Swift Look At on Fab \u00b7 Documentation Bone Chain Control \u2014 Drive an entire chain with a single node, reducing setup complexity. Weight Curve Distribution \u2014 Smoothly control how much each bone contributes to the Look At effect, enabling natural falloff (e.g., strong on the head, subtle on the spine). Clamp Curve Distribution \u2014 Define per-bone rotation limits to ensure stable and believable motion. Per-Bone Override Settings \u2014 Customize specific bones when defaults aren\u2019t enough, for maximum flexibility. Examples Project This demo video showcases the Swift Look At Chain plugin applied across various skeletal structures, including humanoid and dinosaur characters\u2014covering head, spine, tail, and eye controls. Utilizing curve-driven weight adjustments, cone angle tuning, and axis hints, the plugin achieves smooth, natural look-at behaviors. All scenes were recorded in real-time within a playable environment, with no post-editing, offering a transparent view of the plugin's performance in practical use cases. Executable Examples Project Quick Start Video Humanoid Setup Dino Setup Node Setup This section uses the humanoid character from the Example Project to demonstrate the Swift Look At Chain node. We start with an AnimGraph overview , then focus on the Spine \u2192 Head chain UI and walk through areas 1\u20136 . Insert the corresponding close-up screenshots for each area. Area 1\uff5cChain Definition Purpose: Define the bone range driven by the chain. Keys: - Start Bone (e.g., spine_01 ) - End Bone (e.g., head ) The system collects all continuous bones between Start and End to form the chain. Area 2\uff5cDefault Bone Settings Purpose: Provide a single default behavior for all bones in the chain. Any bone not explicitly overridden (Area 4) will use these defaults. Common fields (examples): - Local Look At Axis - Use Look Up Axis / Up Axis Locked / Local Look Up Axis - Look At Clamp / Clamp Ratio / Approximate Clamp / Cone Orientation Socket - Damping Time (seconds) Tip: Start with defaults. Only add overrides when a bone truly needs a different behavior. Area 3\uff5cCurves / Distribution Purpose: Distribute influence and clamp intensity along the chain using two curves: - Weight Curve \u2014 how much each bone contributes (0\u20131) - Clamp Curve \u2014 how strong the angle limit is for each bone (0\u20131) Sampling & normalization (important): - Curves are uniformly sampled by bone index (from chain start to end). - After sampling, the maximum value is normalized to 1.0 , and all other samples are scaled relative to it (including the max itself). - Focus on the shape/trend of the curve rather than absolute numbers. Area 4\uff5cOverride Settings (Optional) Purpose: Provide per-bone customization when a specific bone requires behavior different from the defaults (e.g., axes, clamp, damping). Recommendations: - If defaults work, don\u2019t add overrides . - Only create entries for bones that truly need different behavior. - If multiple bones share the same policy, duplicate the entry and change the bone name. Area 5\uff5cIgnored Bones (Optional) Purpose: Exclude bones that should not be processed by this chain (e.g., helper or special-purpose bones). Typical use cases: - Avoid conflicts when sharing control with physics or Control Rig - Reduce evaluation by excluding visual-only bones Area 6\uff5cDebug Draw Settings Purpose: Visualize the chain behavior in the viewport for development and teaching. Common toggles: - Show Bone Frame - Show Original / Modified Look At Axis - Show Original / Modified Up Axis - Show Clamp Cone - Show Desired Target Suggested for early tuning: enable Clamp Cone , and Modified Axes . Summary Minimal setup: Areas 1 (Chain) + 2 (Defaults) + 3 (Curves) are usually sufficient for a natural result. Advanced control: Use Area 4 (Overrides) only when specific bones require unique behavior. Debug efficiency: Area 6 (Debug) greatly improves iteration speed during development. Properties Runtime Node Properties Property Description Start Bone Name of the first bone in the chain. Defines where the chain begins. End Bone Name of the last bone in the chain. Defines where the chain ends. Default Settings Default parameters applied to all bones in the chain, unless explicitly overridden. Includes axis definitions, clamp, up axis settings, and damping. Weight Curve Curve controlling the influence weight of each bone in the chain. Sampled at equal intervals, normalized by the maximum value, and applied per bone. Clamp Curve Curve controlling the clamp angle of each bone in the chain. Sampled at equal intervals, normalized by the maximum value, and used to scale clamp angles. Look At Target Target socket or bone to look at. Used if no explicit bone reference is provided. Supports offset via Look At Location . Look At Location Target offset. If LookAtBone is empty, it is in world space; otherwise, it is relative to LookAtBone or LookAtSocket local space. Override Settings Per-bone override configuration. Bones listed here will use custom settings instead of the default chain configuration. Ignored Bones Bones excluded from the look-at rotation. Useful for skipping specific joints. Per-Bone Settings (FLookAtChainLinkSettings) Property Description Local Look At Axis Axis in local space that should point toward the target. Use Look Up Axis Whether to use an additional Up axis for stabilizing rotation. Up Axis Locked If enabled, locks the Up axis when Use Look Up Axis is active. Local Look Up Axis Defines the local Up axis direction when Use Look Up Axis is enabled. Look At Clamp Maximum look-at rotation in degrees. Rotation will be clamped within a cone. Clamp Ratio Ratio between pitch and yaw constraints when clamping. Cone Orientation Socket Optional socket providing a rotation offset for the clamp cone\u2019s central axis. Approximate Clamp Optimization: available when Up Axis is enabled but not locked. Trades precision for better performance. Damping Time Damping time (seconds) for smoothing bone rotation. Smaller values = faster/snappier response; larger values = smoother/slower response. Debug Properties Property Description Default Debug Draw Settings Global default visualization settings applied to the entire chain. Override Debug Draw Settings Per-bone override visualization settings. Specific bones can have custom debug draw toggles, independent of the default. Show Bone Frame Display the local coordinate system axes of each bone. Show Original Look At Axis Display the bone\u2019s original Look At axis before modification. Show Original Up Axis Display the bone\u2019s original Up axis before modification. Show Modified Look At Axis Display the bone\u2019s Look At axis after modification. Show Modified Up Axis Display the bone\u2019s Up axis after modification. Show Clamp Cone Display the clamp cone used to limit rotation. Show Desired Target Display the final desired target position.
